# FileReFollow

Follow redirects that are in the form of HTML files, such as for fixing HTML downloads accidentally generated by the "DownloadThemAll!" extension for Firefox.

## Usage
- Download a list of files using the "DownloadThemAll!" extension for Firefox.
- Run filerefollow in the directory where the download files exist (files that have a binary extension such as ".mid" but actually contain html).
- That's it! After running the script, HTML will be moved to an "html" folder, and media will be downloaded to a "media" folder.
  - For each file that was skipped, the html file will not be moved. This allows continuing where you left off later after your connection, the website, or this program was improved.
